## Cracking the Coding INterview Solutions
- This repositoreiss will eb meant for each solution that I solve in the well-known interview-prep book, Cracking the coding interview, by Dayle Laakmann McDowell

## Goal
- Try to solve as many of these problems as possible

## Reason Why
- this is mostly to improve my problem solving skills, but as well as improve my coding skills, and it's also helpful for my future classes if I already know how to solve for a lot of coding problems.

## Language and Technology
- Since I'm still coding in c++ for my classes, these problems will be written mostly in c++, I use python a lot so it will aslo be written in python, and perhaps other languages too if I want to learn multiple languages.
